# NRPE DISK USAGE PLUGIN
#
# Program: Disk Usage plugin written to be used with Netsaint and NRPE
# License: GPL
# Copyright (c) 2000 Jeremy Hanmer (jeremy@newdream.net)
#
# Last Modified: 10/23/00
# 
# Information:  Basically, I wrote this because I had to deal with large numbers of 
# machines with a wide range of disk configurations, and with dynamically mounted 
# partitions.  The basic check_disk plugin relied on a static configuration file which
# doesn't lend itself to being used in a heterogeneous environnment (especially when
# you can't guarantee that the devices listed in the configuration file will be mounted).
#
# Bugs:  Currently, this plugin only works on EXT2 partitions (although it's easy to change).
#
# Command Line: diskusage.pl <warning percentage> <critical percentage>
#
# Tested Systems:  Mandrake 7.1/Intel, Debian 2.2/Intel, Debian 2.1/Intel
